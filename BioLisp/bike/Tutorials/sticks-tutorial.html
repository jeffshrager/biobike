 <p>You are sitting in your isolated Antarctic work station monitoring the size of the 

atmospheric ozone hole. Truth be told, this doesn't occupy a whole lot of your attention, and 

you are without much enthusiasm twiddling the dial on your short-wave radio, hoping to pick up 

something to get you to the next hour. You're about to settle into a Chilean weather report 

when the radio suddenly stops working -- just static. </p>
 <p>Then through the clicking and squealing you hear quite distinctly: </p>
 <p align="center" class="style21">&quot;Greetings, carbon-based creature!&quot;</p>
 <p>The surprising part is that the voice is a dead-on match for Mr. Rogers.</p>
 <p>First contact! You grab your microphone. What can you say now, at perhaps THE critical 

juncture in human history? Amazingly, you can still think logically, and you consider that if 

&quot;carbon-based&quot; is worthy of alien comment, then ....</p>
 <p>&quot;<span class="style28">Greetings,</span>&quot; you respond, &quot;<span 

class="style28">non-carbon-based creature!</span>&quot;</p>
 <p>&quot;<span class="style23">Very good!</span>&quot; chuckles Mr. Rogers.</p>
 <p>Now what? Should you try to reach the Strategic Air Command to warn about flying saucers 

soon to hover over Washington? You decide to take instead the historic path towards friendly 

encounter.</p>
 <p>&quot;<span class="style28">How is it going on Alpha Centauri?</span>&quot; A wild guess, 

you admit, but who knows? </p>
 <p>&quot;<span class="style23">I am sorry,</span>&quot; the alien responds. &quot;<span 

class="style23">Please provide the missing antecedent of the impersonal pronoun you used and I 

will be able to describe its mechanism of locomotion.</span>&quot;</p>
 <p>Hmmmmm. This is going to be more difficult than you thought.</p>
 <p>&quot;<span class="style28">Never mind... How are things on your end?</span>&quot;</p>
 <p>&quot;<span class="style23">Anterior or posterior?</span>&quot;</p>
 <p>&quot;<span class="style25"><span class="style28">...???</span>.</span>&quot; </p>
 <p class="style26">Commentary</p>
 <p>As you can see, English may not be the language of choice for a first encounter with ETs. 

You may consider this an insight of little practical value, but no, we face a similar problem 

all the time, even now: How do you communicate with computers?</p>
 <p>Note that this is a more difficult problem than the one you faced in the Antarctic. The 

alien, one would suspect, accepted that you were conscious being and could use that fact to 

try to figure out what you mean. Computers - at least at present - have no internal model for 

your mind, and without one, understanding natural human languages is impossible.</p>
 <p>And yet, we <em><strong>must</strong></em> communicate with computers, because we need 

them to do what we can't do by ourselves: direct complex manufacturing processes, coordinate 

sprawling communication systems, analyze huge sets of biological data. You might respond, 

&quot;Why do I have to communicate with a computer? I don't communicate with my toaster.. I 

just put in the bread and push the button. &quot; That would be fine if we could build a 

machine for every task at hand. But there are too many tasks, tasks whose processes must be 

continuously modified. Instead we have built a <em><strong>general</strong></em> machine - the 

digital computer - and are left with the problem of how to tell it what we want it to do.</p>
 <p>We need a well-defined, formal language.</p>
 
 <hr color="#000099">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>To some extent, English is a formal language. It has forms. For example:</p>
 <p align="center"><img 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/SVO1.jpg" width="400" height="94"> </p>
 <p align="left">It is also recursive - forms can lie within forms - leading to the 
possibility of endless variation. For example:</p>
 <p align="center"><img 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/SVO2.jpg" width="555" height="134"> </p>
<p align="left">Nonetheless, English is a mess. To talk to a computer, we need something much 

more regular and unambiguous. Let's start small, building a language that ought to provide the 

best chance of allowing humans to speak to computers. It will have the following 

properties:</p>
 <ol>
   <li>It will be English-like (to accommodate us)</li>
   <li>It will have strict syntax (so the computer knows exactly where to find the subject, 

where to find the verb)</li>
   <li>It will be allow recursive forms (so we can express thoughts of some complexity)</li>
   <li>It will not require of the computer any background knowledge outside of simple 

addition.</li>
 </ol>
 <p>From this groundwork, we'll build a language through which we can talk arithmetic to the 

computer. If we can't do even that, we're doomed.</p>
 <p>Let's do it.</p>

 <hr color="#000099">
 <h3 class="style27"><a name="part1">I. Preliminaries: Things and Functions</h3></a>
 <p>The language we'll build will have two possible forms:</p>
 <ul>
   <li><a href="#formtype1">FORM TYPE 1: Thing</a></li>
   <li><a href="#formtype2">FORM TYPE 2: Function</a></li>
   <p><strong><a name="formtype1"></a><u>FORM TYPE 1: Thing</u>(<em>What did I just say?</em>) 

</strong></p>
   <ol>
     <li> Type a thing into the Command Box (the thin white window) and BioBIKE will tell you 

what you just typed in. Of course, the thing has to be a <em><strong>valid</strong></em> 

thing, according to the rules of the language, otherwise you'll get an error. </li>
     <p>Try typing anything that pops into your head (and press Enter). If you've got writer's 

block, they try this:
     <pre>
>>I am Sam
 </pre>
     <li>Unless you're incredibly lucky (or you've played this game before), you got a 

response something like:
         <blockquote>
           <blockquote>
             <blockquote>
               <p align="left"> <strong>Unknown asdfasdf </strong> </p>
             </blockquote>
           </blockquote>
         </blockquote>
     </li>
     <p>That's because you didn't type in a valid THING. OK - we can't avoid it -- what is a 

thing? According to the rules of the language, a thing may consist of any of the 

following:</p>
     <ul>
       <li>Quoted thing: Anything between double quotes [BioBIKE responds by repeating what 

you typed]</li>
       Try something like:
       <pre>
>>"I am Sam"
 </pre>
       <li>Asterisk thing: (an asterisk) -- [BioBIKE responds by repeating back its own last 

response]<br>
         Try: </li>
       <pre>
>>*
 </pre>
       <li>Symbol thing: A symbol (or name) previously defined to be a valid thing [BioBIKE 

responds be telling you what the valid thing is] You'll learn in a moment how to define 

symbols, but a few symbols come automatically defined:<br>
           <br>
           <ul>
             <li>True or T, which stands for truth</li>
             <li>False or NIL, which stands for falsity</li>
           </ul>
       </li>
       <br>
      Try this:
      <pre>
>>true
</pre>
     </ul>
     <li>I just introduced yet another concept - <em><strong>symbol</strong></em>. A symbol is 

any collection of characters (letters, numbers, etc) that does not contain a space or 

parenthesis. There are other restrictions, but that's enough for now. </li>
     Try this:
     <pre>
>>Multiword symbol?
 </pre>
    and then this:
    <pre>
>>Multiword-symbol?
</pre>
    <p>The error message will tell you what set of characters BioBIKE considers to constitute 

a single symbol. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
   </ol>
   <p><strong><a name="formtype2"></a><u>FORM TYPE 2: Function</u> (<em>Do what I just

  <ol>
    <p>Functions are always of the form:</p>
    <p align="center"><img 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/function1.jpg" width="532" height="100"></p>
    <p align="left">They:</p>
    <OL type=a>
      <li>Begin with an open parenthesis</li>
      <li>Continue with the name of a valid function</li>
      <li>Continue (optionally) with one or more things or a functions</li>
      <li>End with a close parenthesis</li>
    </OL>
    <p>What number and kinds of things or functions follow the name of a function depends on 

the nature of the function. A command that doesn't fit this form is not a valid function (of 

course that doesn't mean that everything that <strong><em>does</em></strong> fit the form 

<em><strong>is</strong></em> a valid function). </p>
    <li>Try this:
        <pre>
>>SPELL fish
   </pre>
    </li>
    <li>That didn't work. Since what you typed didn't begin with a parenthesis, BioBIKE 

decided it couldn't be a function. So it must be a thing. But SPELL is not a valid thing, so 

error.</li>
    Try this:
    <pre>
>>(SPELL fish)
 </pre>
    <li>Still doesn't work, but at least different messages! The first was:
        <blockquote>
          <p class="style30"> Warning: While compiling these undefined functions were 

referenced: <br>
          SPELL.</p>
        </blockquote>
        BioBIKE recognized that <strong>SPELL</strong> was the name of a function, because it 

is the first symbol after an opening parenthesis. But it is not a function BioBIKE 

understands. The second message was:
        <blockquote>
          <p class="style30">Attempt to take the value of the unbound variable `FISH'</p>
        </blockquote>
    </li>
    <p>This one you've seen before. FISH isn't a valid thing. And it certainly isn't a 

function.</p>
    <li>Fix the second problem by putting the word between double quotes, making it a valid 

thing. </li>
    Try this:
    <pre>
>>(SPELL "fish")
 </pre>
    <p>Now BioBIKE recognized "fish" to be a thing, but it complains that it never heard of 

the function named SPELL before. </p>
    <li>How can we teach BioBIKE what <strong>SPELL</strong> means? The only way is to define 

it in terms of things BioBIKE already understands. Fortunately, BioBIKE has many previously 

defined functions. For Example:</li>
    Try this:
    <pre>
>>(SPLIT "fish")
 </pre>
    <p>That's probably something like what you may have intended by <strong>(SPELL "fish") 

<br>
           <br>
       </strong>
    <li> Now we can define SPELL in terms of SPLIT, using the following complex function: 

</li>
    <div align="center">
      <blockquote>
        <p align="left"><br>
        <img 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/function2.jpg" width="581" height="247"> </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
    </div>
    <p>Try this (put it in the big window, hereafter called the Program Box):
    <pre>
>>(DEFINE-FUNCTION Spell (word) 
>>  (SPLIT word)
>>  )
 </pre>
    <li>Now try again:
        <pre>
>>(SPELL "fish")
   </pre>
    </li>
    <p>The newly defined function <strong>SPELL</strong> took the thing it was given 

(represented internally by the symbol word) and gave it to the function SPLIT it into 
individual letters. These individual letters were returned to <strong>SPELL</strong>, which 
returned them to you.</p>
    <p>Any function, whether it is automatically provided or you define it yourself, returns 
the value of the last form in the function and that value replaces the function itself. We'll 
see this in action momentarily.</p>

 <h3 class="style27"><a name="part2">II. The Basic Stick Language </h3></a>

  </li>
   <li>Our language consists now solely of the <strong>thing</strong> &quot;|&quot; and the

<br>
  <span class="style27"><a name="part3">III. Extended Stick Language - Arithmetic</span></a>
     <p class="style31 style33"><b>Addition</b></p>
 <p>Using the function &quot;ONE-MORE-THAN&quot;, we can define a function that performs 

addition of two groups of sticks. Suppose we have two bundles of sticks:</p>
 <blockquote>
   <blockquote>
     <blockquote>
       <p> <img width="276" height="135" 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/sticks_bundle.jpg"> </p>
     </blockquote>
   </blockquote>
</blockquote>
 <p>We want to add these two bundles together, but the computer only knows how to add one 

stick at a time. </p>
<pre>
>>(ONE-MORE-THAN (ONE-MORE-THAN (ONE-MORE-THAN (ONE-MORE-THAN "|||"))))
</pre>
 <p>This works though it's rather tedious to type ONE-MORE-THAN so many times.<br> But you get the idea that</p>
 <p> <img width="338" height="99" 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/addstick1.jpg"> </p>
 <p>is broken down to: </p>
 <p> <img width="625" height="98" 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/addstick2.jpg"> </p>
 <p>The concept of addition is that each stick in the second bundle is added to the first bundle until all sticks are gone. 
Keeping this notion in mind, we will now try to define a function &quot;ADD-STICKS&quot;.</p>
 <p>First, we will take a stepwise approach to understand the logic of defining a function called ADD-STICKS.</p>
 <ol>
   <li>Let's call the first bundle with three sticks "bundle1", the second bundle with four 

sticks "bundle2". </li>

<pre>
>> (DEFINE bundle1 as "|||")
</pre>
<pre>
>> (DEFINE bundle2 as "||||")
</pre>

<li>We want to add each stick in bundle2 into bundle1.
<p>    Each successive iteration, the result is incremented by one stick. How many times 

should we perform the ONE-MORE-THAN operation? Exactly the same number as the number of sticks 

in bundle2. </p>
</li>
<p><img width="712" height="160" 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/loop.jpg"></p>
<p><br>
  This operation can be automated in a <strong>LOOP</strong>. In a loop, you set a statement once, and the task is carried out repeatedly until the condition is met.  </p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><br>
 <img width="447" height="172" 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/loop-diagram.jpg">  <br>
    </p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Let's try a simple loop.
</p>
<pre>
>> (FOR-EACH stick in bundle2
>>   (DISPLAY-LINE stick))
</pre>
You see all of the sticks in bundle2 displayed.<br><br>
Now initialize the variable. You want the starting number to be the same as the number of sticks in bundle1.
<pre>
>> (FOR-EACH stick IN bundle2
>>    INITIALIZE result = bundle1
>>    (DISPLAY-LINE (ONE-MORE-THAN result)))
</pre>

The above doesn't work the way you expected – it just gives 1 + bundle1 sticks several times… because the result isn't UPDATED. To update:
<pre>
>>(FOR-EACH stick IN bundle2
>>    INITIALIZE result = bundle1
>>    (ASSIGN result = (ONE-MORE-THAN result))                      
>>    (DISPLAY-LINE result))
</pre>
This result shows that each turn in the loop returns the result that is one more than the previous result.

</li></ol>
Now we are going to combine what we just did within a function.<br>

<pre>
>>(DEFINE-FUNCTION ADD-STICKS
>>   REQUIRED (bundle1 (AND) bundle2)
>>   INITIALIZE result = bundle1
>>   BODY
>>     (LOOP FOR stick in bundle2
>>         (DEFINE result AS (ONE-MORE-THAN result)))
>>   (RETURN-FROM ADD-STICKS result))
</pre>
<p>We just  created a function called &quot;ADD-STICKS&quot;. Try:</p>
<pre>
>> (ADD-STICKS "|||" AND "||||")
</pre>
<p><br>
  <br>
<hr color="#000099">
<span class="style35">Subtraction</span><br>
<p>You've taught the computer how to do addition based on the predefined function ONE-MORE-THAN. Can you apply the same logic to define different arithmetic functions? Is it 
possible to define a function called SUBTRACT-STICKS with minimal modification to ADD-STICKS?</p>

  <p>Consider:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>What is the nature of this function?<br>
      How do you explain subtraction in terms of our stick language, in the same way we explained addition above?<br>
      What missing concept do you need in order to define subtraction? </p>
    </blockquote>
<p><blockquote>
<img width="360" height="99" 
src="livetutorial-files/sticks-tutorial/subtract_stick.jpg"></p></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>The missing concept has been predefined for you. You should be able to figure out what it's called and how it works. If you're right, you should be able to use the function within 

BioBIKE (in the same way you've used earlier functions), giving it some number of sticks and 
getting the predicted number back.
  </p>
</li><br>
<hr color="#000099">

<p class="style37"><strong>1a. Extra Challenge!</strong></p>
<p class="style37">Although the missing concept has been provide for you (if you can guess its name), You could also write a function yourself that doew the job, relying only on ONE-MORE-THAN plus logic. If you want to go this route, complete the following:</p>

      (RETURN-FROM my-function result))</span>
</pre>
<hr color="#000099">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the mystery function supplied to you (or that you've written), and the following skeletal program, develop the function SUBTRACT-STICKS:
